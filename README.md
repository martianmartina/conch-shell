Connection through music and images

Music can play an important role in how we remember past events. What we listened to in middle school is different from high school. What we listened to at 3 am may be different from our afternoon preferences. On Conch, this can be used to form connections, either with other people, or with ourselves, in the past. Public posts are only allowed to contain visuals and music, with tags stating the connection between the two. For example, a bright day may prompt a happy song, or a walk in Paris may call for french music. Commenters are only allowed to list song choices that contain at least one similar tag to the poster. This gives all users a way to find new music recommended specifically for any mood, time, location, or weather. It also allows users to connect through music, as the only way to talk to others is through similar tags. That way, late night listeners or early morning music lovers can enjoy their songs together. And if a user likes a new song, they can save it on their own likes file, which can be linked to Spotify. Private posts are available as well, which offer the journaling feature. This way, people can mark their own journey, with the ability to look back with music to accompany their memory. Conch is meant to be a simple app. A way of connection without the possible toxicity of words. It is to be enjoyed in the way simple acts often are, a melody in the moment.
